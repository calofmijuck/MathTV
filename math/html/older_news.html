              I have finally added some of the Lecture Notes I had, that weren't scanned.<br><br>
              These files were added:<br><br>
              &nbsp;&bull; Korean High School Math <br>
              &nbsp;&bull; Basic Topics of KMO <br>
              &nbsp;&bull; Calculus Revisited: Elementary Complex Variables<br>
              &nbsp;&bull; Linear Algebra<br>
              &nbsp;&bull; Mathematics for Computer Science<br>
              &nbsp;&bull; Introduction to Computer Science and Programming<br>
              &nbsp;&bull; Introduction to Algorithms<br><br>
              It really took a lot of effor to scan these, I really wish I had a good scanner I could use.<br>
              You can check out my notes here: <a href="data/lecture-notes.html">Lecture Notes</a>

              Check out the new feature on this website! You can plot functions here!
              <br>
              Note that you can only plot functions of \(x\).<br>
              You can also drag on the plot screen to move around, scroll to zoom in or out.

          I have been studying C++ and Java, so I was a bit behind on working on this website. <br>
          Additionally, during the last 2 weeks of February, I've been studying about Ubuntu and hosting web servers with Apache.<br><br>
          <b>1)</b> Finally, this website has its own link, <a href="http://www.zxcvber.com:8081">http://www.zxcvber.com:8081</a>. <br>
          Unfortunately, I have currently living in the school dormitory, and they blocked port 80, 443, 8080, so I cannot use them.<br>
          So every time I want to visit my website, I have to put an additional ":8081" to access my website.<br>
          How Convenient!<br><br>
          <b>2)</b> I considered that all the news just got very old, so I moved everything to Older News tab. You won't really have anything to check out there.<br><br>
          <b>3)</b> I am also planning to design a new layout for the whole site and page, but 2018 Spring semester starts tomorrow, so I have no idea when I will be finished with it. <br>Although I don't have any classes tomorrow, I won't be working on this anyway.<br><br>
          <b>4)</b> A new problem <a href="problems/2018.html">2018-03: Cauchy-Schwarz ?</a> has been added. I personally encountered this problem like 10 days ago, it was just a problem on a Grade 10 math textbook. But I had no ideas on how to solve the problem at a "Grade 10 level", while I had many more ideas on how to solve the problem if I ignored the constraint that I had to solve it with only the knowledge of 10th-graders.<br>
          Well, it actually turned out to be very easy, so I would really like to post it up here, and leave it for future reference.<br><br>
          <b>5)</b> I might be changing the name of this site. But I just might be to lazy to do such things. It will probably be applied with the new website layout I will be creating in the (long) future. I have no idea when it will be done. Also, I am terrible at naming things, especially variables. (...) Rather declaring a war might be easier for me...<br><br>
          <b>6)</b> For those of you who actually clicked on the link in 1), you might have noticed the rainbow colors flashing on "zxcvber". I just added them for fun. Now I think you might have just clicked on that link out of curiosity. Hmm...<br><br>
          <b>7)</b> Added a page view counter on the sidebar, only for the main page.

         I was sick for about a week, and everything got a little behind.<br>
         Now that I have fully(?) recovered, I added a new problem!<br>
         I personally came across this problem 2 years ago, and I have really thought a lot about this one!<br>

         The <a href="talks/index.html">Math Talks</a> section has been added! Finally!<br>
         For Math Talks section only, I will try to use as much Korean as possible.<br><br>
         When you get bored while <b>stu</b>(<b>dy</b>ing) math, take a look at some posted I have uploaded.<br>
         I don't want people to think that math is a boring subject, I really wish people knew about its significance. (Maybe I'm asking for too much)
         <br><br>
         Some news have been moved to Older News.<br>
         I am also currently thinking about problem 2018-02.

         <br>
         +) A page icon, also known as favicon has been added!!

         I have added my <a href="data/lecture-notes.html">lecture notes</a> and <a href="data/problem-sets.html">problem sets</a>. The section <i>teaching materials</i> will be added soon.
         <br><br>
         These were originally posted on my Google Site, now I am moving them here. <br>
         <b>+)</b> I also modified my <a href="profile.html">profile</a>, added some brief information about me.<br><br>
         <b>+)</b> While I was editing my pages, I got to look at my files again, which were created when I was in high school. Then the memories of me studying math in high school just came to my mind.<br> &nbsp; I remember studying math in high school as an amazing time because I could train my skills for further studies. It was really fun, and if I really have some time, I would really like to take a step back from what I'm currently doing and take a look at the things I have done in high school.<br>

          Happy New Year!<br>
          The post created last year seems to be a bit old, since an year has passed, but it didn't really seem old to me, so I left it as it is. It is <b>not</b> the case that I am lazy to move the older posts to "Older News".<br><br>
